# Process multiple choice exam

A worked out template for processing the multiple-choice exam scans using the [exams package](https://www.r-exams.org/)

## Usage

1. Put the questions in the `input/01 Questions` folder. 
See each `.md` file for how to specify the questions. 
(If you need to generate a template of `.rmd` file, use `R/01_generate_question_files.R`).
Important meta-information fields are listed in a section below.

2. Name the files such that when sorting by file name, the first question appears first. (E.g., prefix with 01, 02, 03).
The order of the question file name corresponds to the question ID in the `idx` parameter in `R/02_generate_exam_template.R`.

3. Use `R/02_generate_exam_template.R` to generate answer sheets for students to fill in.
See the beginning of the file for the parameter to change such as exam title.
Also, look for the custom question order section to adjust the order.

3. After the exam, scan the sheets and use `03_process_scanned_sheets.R`.



## Question specification meta-information

`extype: schoice` single-choice
`exsolution: 100` is a binary coding of the answer alternatives. The value `100` means that the first item on in the `Answerlist` is the correct answer.
`exshuffle: 3` means `1` correct answer + `2` wrong answers are sampled and used
